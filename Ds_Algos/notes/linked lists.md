single linked list node with pointer only to next element

fast, push and pop

search an element is o(n)

double linked list with pointer to next and prev element

fast push and pop and with option to go back

search an element is o(n)


skip list are list with sorted and with increasin weight, it also has list of pointers to random nodes

we just check through the top of the lists and drop down if the next value is larger 

1-----------------------------5------------------------------10
1-------------3---------------5------------7-----------------10
1-----2-------3-------4------5-----6------7------8-----9----10

if we want to go from 1 - 8

we top with the top list 1 we reach 5 and check that next 10 is greater than our des 8
so we drop one list 5 to 7 we check 10 is greater the our des 8, we drop again, we reach 7 to our des 8
